                Have you ever wondered how rainbows appear? ðŸŒˆ When sunlight shines through raindrops, 
                it bends and splits into beautiful colorsâ€”red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet! 
                This magical phenomenon is called refraction. No two people see the same rainbow because it 
                depends on where you're standing. Isn't that amazing?
